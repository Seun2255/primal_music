## Primal Music

This is a Nextjs project, i used materialUI for the user interface
and the react-loader-spinner library for a nice visual effect.
I'm not a backend dev(i know python and will definitely try and familiarize myself with 
Django later) so i used firebase firestore for the database.
This was a really fun project for me, i learnt quite a lot while working on it.
I used the deezer API for all the songs and albums.
